				<h1> About Me </h1>

				Hello! My name is Michael, and I am from Durham, North Carolina. I attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (2013-2017) and graduated with a Bachelor Degree in Biochemistry. During my times at UNC-CH, I was part of the AFROTC program and held various officer positions in the Carolina Boxing Club. I am currently working as a research assistant in the physical chemistry department at UNC-CH, focusing on studying the solute-solvent interactions on non-radiactive relaxation of titanium(IV) catechol in solvent. In my free time, my interest includes going on trail runs and honing my cooking skill.</p>
				<p>	My interest in programming started when I first took a programming class for chemistry students (COMP 116) at UNC. There, i learned how to incorporate programming in data analysis using programs such as MatLab. I later used this knowledge in my job as an undergraduate assistant in the physical chemistry department, where I perform molecular dynamics on various molecules and mining for useful data. My hope is to improve my programming skill and broaden my knowledge in the world of computer science.</p>
